# Notes for agents working in this repository

## Git workflow

Push finished work directly to `main`. This project does not use a
feature-branch-plus-pull-request review cycle: don't open a PR unless
explicitly asked to.

## Installing Tcl 9

This project's reference evaluator requires Tcl 9.x (`core/core.tcl` checks
this at load time and refuses to run under older Tcl versions, since
Botlish's String semantics count Unicode scalar values, and older Tcl builds
cannot represent astral characters correctly). The canonical baseline for
this repo is `tclsh9.0`.

Do **not** build Tcl 9 from source (slow, and easy to get subtly wrong).
Instead, install it exactly the way `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and
`.github/workflows/bench.yml` do: three `.deb` packages pulled straight from
Ubuntu 25.04 (plucky)'s universe pool, installed with `dpkg -i`:

```sh
set -eu
cd /tmp
base=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe
curl -fsSLO "$base/libt/libtommath/libtommath1_1.3.0-1_amd64.deb"
curl -fsSLO "$base/t/tcl9.0/libtcl9.0_9.0.1+dfsg-1_amd64.deb"
curl -fsSLO "$base/t/tcl9.0/tcl9.0_9.0.1+dfsg-1_amd64.deb"
sudo dpkg -i libtommath1_1.3.0-1_amd64.deb libtcl9.0_9.0.1+dfsg-1_amd64.deb tcl9.0_9.0.1+dfsg-1_amd64.deb
echo 'puts "Tcl [info patchlevel], tcltest [package require tcltest 2.5]"' | tclsh9.0
```

This installs the `tclsh9.0` binary and it is the canonical baseline for
this repo. Use `tclsh9.0` to run everything in this repo (`tests/all.tcl`,
`main.tcl`, `bench/*.tcl`, etc.), matching CI.

Also set `LANG=C.utf8 LC_ALL=C.utf8` (glibc ships `C.utf8` built in, no
`locale-gen` needed): Tcl 9's I/O encoding profile is strict by default,
and with no locale the system encoding falls back to `iso8859-1`, which
makes writing non-ASCII/astral output fail outright instead of being
silently mangled.

## Building the native (Cranelift) backend

`cargo build --release --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml` needs a rustc new
enough for the pinned `cranelift-*`/`wasmtime-internal-*` crates (rustc
1.95+; the sandbox's preinstalled toolchain can be older and will fail with
"is not supported by the following packages"). Fix with:

```sh
rustup toolchain install stable --profile minimal
rustup default stable
```

then build as usual. Without this, `cranelift`/`cranelift-generic` tests
and benchmarks report `{error {NATIVE NOT-BUILT}}` instead of running.

## Running Linux tests from Windows with WSL

The Windows development machine has an Ubuntu 24.04 WSL distribution with
the repository toolchain already installed. Run Linux-native validation from
PowerShell through that distribution, using the mounted Windows checkout:

```powershell
wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-24.04 -- bash -lc 'cd /mnt/c/Users/MarkusWagner/dev/botlish && export LANG=C.utf8 LC_ALL=C.utf8 && tclsh9.0 tests/all.tcl'
```

The WSL checkout is the same working tree as the Windows checkout, not a
separate clone. Check `git status` before running tests and do not stash or
discard changes merely to switch environments.

For mandatory native GC-stress validation, build the release backend and run
the suite with stress enabled inside WSL:

```powershell
wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-24.04 -- bash -lc 'cd /mnt/c/Users/MarkusWagner/dev/botlish && export LANG=C.utf8 LC_ALL=C.utf8 BOTLISH_NATIVE_GC_STRESS=1 && cargo build --release --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml && tclsh9.0 tests/all.tcl'
```

Use WSL for Linux GC-stress results when validating native stack walking;
Windows-native execution exercises a different stack/guard implementation.
